The odin project is for me a step back and a way to try and learn the basics of html/css/javascript instead of jumping into a new framework.

In the past few lesson we had a look at structure of the html page and a way to let the browser know which version of html we are using. The most recent one is html 5
We let the browser know by saying <!DOCTYPE>

The body has a structure of <head> and <body>

in the head we declare metadata of the website like the <title> and <meta charset="UTF-8">

in the body we can declare other html which will be shown in the page itself
<p> shows a paragrah we can make word bold with <b> and incline with <em>

We can create orderd list with <ol> and unorders lists with <ul>

We can create a link with<a> we do need to add the href attribute to make it a link tough.

To show a image we use the <img> tag with a source and an alt attribute
